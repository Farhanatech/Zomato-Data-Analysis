## Zomato Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Zomato restaurants dataset.

Contents
--------
- `zomato-data-analysis-project.ipynb` — main analysis notebook (visualizations, preprocessing, and short conclusions).
- `archive/Zomato data .csv` — the dataset used by the notebook (CSV file).

Getting started
---------------
1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Make sure you have a Python 3 environment with the required packages installed.

Recommended packages
--------------------
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the minimal requirements using pip:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

How to run the notebook
-----------------------
1. Open `zomato-data-analysis-project.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Lab.
2. Select a Python kernel that has the packages installed.
3. Run the notebook cells in order. The notebook expects the dataset at `archive/Zomato data .csv` (relative to the notebook). If you moved the CSV, either update the path in the cell that calls `pd.read_csv(...)` or place the CSV back into the `archive` subfolder.

Common issues & fixes
----------------------
- FileNotFoundError: No such file or directory: 'Zomato data .csv'
	- Cause: the notebook originally attempted to read `Zomato data .csv` from the current working directory.
	- Fix: ensure the CSV file is in `archive/` and the read call uses `archive/Zomato data .csv`, or provide the correct absolute path.

- NameError or unexpected variable names
	- Example: if a variable `f` is referenced where `df` (dataframe) is intended, change the variable to `df` consistently or update the references.

Short overview of the notebook
------------------------------
- Imports libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
- Loads the dataset into a DataFrame (variable `df`).
- Performs preprocessing (e.g., cleans `rate` values into numeric floats).
- Produces visualizations: countplots, line plots, histograms, boxplots, and a heatmap.
- Groups and aggregates some columns (e.g., votes by restaurant type).

Key results (short)
-------------------
- Many restaurants fall into the "Dining" category.
- Dining restaurants received the highest total votes in the dataset.
- Ratings distribution is concentrated around mid-high values (approx. 3.5–4.0 in the processed data).

Notes
-----
- This README uses the same file name as the project (`READ.me`). If you prefer the conventional `README.md`, you can rename this file.
- If you want, I can create a small requirements file (`requirements.txt`) and/or run a quick kernel check to ensure the notebook runs end-to-end.

License
-------
This project contains dataset analysis examples and is provided as-is for learning and demonstration.

Contact / Next steps
--------------------
If you'd like, I can:
- Add a `requirements.txt` with pinned versions.
- Rename this file to `README.md` and add a short summary image of key visualizations.
- Run the notebook headlessly and confirm all cells execute successfully.
